# color.css - Material Colors

## Usage

Color.css allows for good looking colors to be associated with classes, so that without looking at other sources you know what class will give you a good looking blue or red, and how light and dark the color is and if it is an accent color.

Colours have been lifted off from [Google's Material Design Specification](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-palette) and transferred over onto [color.finnthewebdesigner.com](http://color.finnthewebdesigner.com/) for easier use and rememberability, they are both essentially the same.

##Colors

There are 19 key colours (also including black, white), each with 10 shades and 4 accents (brown, gret and blue grey do not have accents) and identical numbering system: 50,100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900,A100,A200,A400,A700
